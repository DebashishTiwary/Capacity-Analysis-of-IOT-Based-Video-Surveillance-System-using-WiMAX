# Capacity-Analysis-of-IOT-based-video-surveillance-system-using-WiMAX-Technology
This research project focuses on Capacity Analysis of IoT Based Video Surveillance

System using WiMAX Technology. The project aims in analyzing the potential of

IoT-based video surveillance using WiMAX Technology which is an important test with

implications for societal well-being. It emphasizes how IoT and WiMAX technology can

enhance security through real time monitoring, remote access and efficient data

transmission.

The project uses ESP32-CAM which is a versatile module equipped with a powerful

ESP32-S chip and a built-in camera. It features Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, making

it ideal for IoT applications that require wireless communication. It also uses FTDI232

(FTDI Programmer), and PIR Sensor. FTDI is a USB-to-serial converter that enables easy

programming and debugging of microcontrollers. It connects the ESP32-CAM to a

computer via USB, allowing us to upload code and communicate with the module. The

Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor detects infrared radiation from moving objects. It is used

for motion detection, triggering the ESP32-CAM to capture media when movement is

detected.

The findings of the project showcase a successful implementation and uniqueness in

robustness and efficiency. WiMAX provides a wide coverage area and high-speed data

transmission, ensuring reliable connectivity for remote surveillance applications. The

integration of ESP32 camera and PIR sensor enables motion detection ensuring security.

The outcomes of this research project contribute in Capacity Analysis of IoT Based

Video Surveillance System using WiMAX Technology. This study aims towards social

contribution like enhanced public safety, crime deterrence and prevention, smart city

development. Further research and development in this field can pave the way for future

innovations and advancements
